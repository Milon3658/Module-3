    <p class="main-blog">The Bay of Bengal is the northeastern part of the <a href="#">Indian Ocean</a> , bounded on the
        west and
        northwest by <b>India</b>, on the north by <strong>Bangladesh</strong>, and on the east by Myanmar and the
        Andaman and Nicobar Islands of India. Its southern limit is a line between Sangaman Kanda, Sri Lanka, and the
        north westernmost point of Sumatra, Indonesia. It is the largest water region called a bay in the world. There
        are countries dependent on the Bay of Bengal in South Asia and Southeast Asia. During the existence of British
        India, it was named as the Bay of Bengal after the historic Bengal region. At the time, the Port of Kolkata
        served as the gateway to the Crown rule in India. Cox's Bazar, the longest sea beach in the world and
        Sundarbans, the largest mangrove forest and the natural habitat of the Bengal tiger, are located along the bay.
        <i> The Bay of Bengal</i> occupies an area of <i>2,600,000</i> square kilometres <i> (1,000,000 sq mi).</i> A
        number of large rivers flow into the Bay of Bengal: the Ganges–Hooghly, the Padma, the Brahmaputra–Jamuna, the
        Barak–Surma–Meghna, the Irrawaddy, the Godavari, the Mahanadi, the Brahmani, the Baitarani, the Krishna and the
        Kaveri.
        Important ports include Krishnapatnam, Chennai, Ennore, Chittagong, Colombo, Kolkata-Haldia, Mongla, Paradip,
        Port Blair, Matarbari, Thoothukudi, Visakhapatnam and Dhamra. Among the smaller ports are Gopalpur Port,
        Kakinada and Payra.

            <h4>This is what Sundarban – the world’s largest delta entails for its visitors. A Sundarban weekend tour
                can be a
                good way to detoxify your body and mind from the mundane city spaces. It can also be an excellent way to
                enrich
                yourself about ‘life on a delta.’The world’s most grand delta – Sundarbans is formed by the confluence
                of three rivers Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna. It is a complex network of islands connected by rivulets
                and rivers spread across the eastern Indian
                state of West Bengal and the western region of Bangladesh....

            <h4>November 12, 2018 (Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh) A mass human migration began on 25 August 2017 following
                retaliation by Rohingya Arsa militants who launched deadly attacks on more than 30 police post.
                Rohingyas began arriving Cox's Bazaar district of Bangladesh that borders Myanmar after troops, backed
                by local Buddhist mobs, burned their villages, attacked and killed civilians. Nearly 7,000 Rohingya
                (including more than 700 children under the age of five) were killed after the violence broke out, and
                there was widespread rape and abuse Rohingya women and girls reported. Nearly 300 villages were
                partially or totally burned down in northern Rakhine. Satellite images show many places where Rohingya
                villages were burned down, while nearby ethnic Rakhine villages are intact....</h4><br>

            <h4>Locally known as Sagar Kannya (Daughter of the Sea), Kuakata is a picturesque coastal strand about 30 km
                in length and 6 km in breadth. Derived from the Bengali word 'Kua' for "well" in association with a well
                that was dug by early Rakhine settlers on the seashore in their quest to find drinking water after being
                expelled from Arakan (Myanmar) by the Mughals in 1784, today it is home to Hindu and Buddhist
                communities. Kuakata holds a myriad of elements from sandy beach and forest to sea and sky, and is known
                for some outstanding sunrises and sunsets over the Bay of Bengal....</h4><br>
